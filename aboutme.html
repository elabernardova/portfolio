        <p>

            I am 22 years old student of Multimedia Design and Communication. </p>
        <p>I was born in Prague and was living there until I have moved to Copenhagen in Autumn 2017. </p>
        <p> I was always interested in design and art. For 2 years I was working in fashion industry, which is now closely conected with media and that was the first time I realized I would like to be a part of the process of creating media.</p>
        <p>My main interest is web and graphic design, but I enjoy web develpment as well .I am really interested in music and in the future I would like to connect these two things and to create something amazing!</p>
